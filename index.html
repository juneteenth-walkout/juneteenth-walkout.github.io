          In celebration of Juneteenth, and in solidarity with the Black Lives
          Matter protests, join your fellow employees for a virtual walkout on
          Friday, June 19th @ 2 PM PST.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s use this time off to observe Juneteenth, recognize Black
          history, and pledge to support racial and social justice within Esri
          and beyond. However, observing Juneteenth alone is inadequate. Let’s
          all reflect on ways that we can support and work towards improving our
          culture at Esri, specifically for underrepresented Black and
          Indigenous employees. Let’s signal beyond just our internal community
          that we stand with our country as one body that will do each of our
          parts in repairing our internal practices to be more equitable, with
          hopes that it will externally make an impact on the communities we
          serve.
        </p>

        <h2>How</h2>
