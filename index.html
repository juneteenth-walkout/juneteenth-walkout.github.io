          In celebration of Juneteenth, and in solidarity with the Black Lives
          Matter protests, join your fellow employees for a virtual walkout on
          Friday, June 19th.
        </p>

        <p>
          Demand Esri to observe Juneteenth as a paid holiday, recognize Black
          history, and pledge support for racial and social justice. However,
          observing Juneteenth alone is inadequate. The under representation of
          Black and Indigenous employees at Esri signals a systemic problem that
          mirrors our country and as a community, we must demand Esri to assess
          and repair its hiring practice to be more equitable.
        </p>

        <h2>How</h2>
        <p>
          Learn more about Juneteenth history. On Friday June 19, use sick time,
          PTO, or just stop working at 2 PM. Make sure to let your supervisor
          know why you're doing it. Feel free to include this flyer in your
          notice.
        </p>
        <h2>What should I do once I've walked out</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Read Black history. Most of it were erased or edited from history
            lessons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attend a local Juneteenth celebration.
          </li>
          <li>Register to vote, if you are eligible</li>
          <li>Volunteer at a local Black non-profit organization</li>
          <li>
            Write or call local elected officials. Ask them to defund the police
            and invest the money to Black education and social services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What if I can't</h2>
        <p>
          If you have prior plans, we ask that you voice your support of this
          employee action and share this flyer with colleagues.
